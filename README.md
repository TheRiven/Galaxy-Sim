Galaxy Political Sim - Game Experiment 

This is a experimental galactic political & economic simulation game, using a randomly generated 
galaxy, possibly moving up to a universe later.

This is being created by a Novice programmer so will most likely end-up somewhat rubbish but it should be interesting
to make.

It will hopefully grow to include: 

- Indepth stats for all planets (inhabited and surveyed)
- Multiple political systems that will allow diffrent rulesets for what a player can do,
  such as if they can directly control a planets economy or if the planets are self-governed.
- Diplomacy - Trade Agreements, Defence Pacts, Federations...
- Modular ship building
- Fleet based combat

And probably a few others that i will think of along the way!
